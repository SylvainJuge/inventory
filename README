Idea : index content stored in a set of folders and find duplicates


# identical files in different locations
hash1 -> /path/location2
hash1 -> /path/location1

# hash only includes content, not filenames
- file hash : hash of its content
- folder hash : hash of its contents hashes

- file has a reference on folder, thus when we have identical hashes we can compare locations
- folder has a reference on parent folder (if any), thus when we have identical hashes we can compare locations

index contains entries sorted, with folders before files for easy compare
