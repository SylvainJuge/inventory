- compute sha1 for single file

- create blob object
    - hash

- create tree object
    - list of [ blob, file name ]
    - hash : sha1 of all items above

- compute sha1 for tree object

- objects storage from/to text files
    - write blob
    - read blob
    - write tree
    - read tree

- compare indexes
    - simple comparison (compare sorted lists of hashes)
    - bloom filter to compute intersection fast ?

- find duplicates in different tree locations
    -> is there a list of all tree objects where a blob is stored (reverse link)?
