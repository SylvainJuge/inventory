x compute sha1 for single file

x create tree item object
    - hash
    - name
    - list of children

x print index content in ascii
x hide root object in tree
x rename TreeItem to "Item"
x mavenize project
x make jar executable
x create packages
x compute sha1 for tree object

- filter files

- command line interface
    - print analysis outpout as ascii tree

- bootstrap tests

- enhance sha1 on tree objects
    - don't use string representation of children hash(es)

- data structures structures  from/to text files
    - write blob
    - read blob
    - write tree
    - read tree

- compare indexes
    - simple comparison (compare sorted lists of hashes)
    - bloom filter to compute intersection fast ?

- find duplicates in different tree locations
    -> is there a list of all tree objects where a blob is stored (reverse link)?
