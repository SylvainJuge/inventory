x compute sha1 for single file

x create tree item object
    - hash
    - name
    - list of children

x print index content in ascii

- compute sha1 for tree object

- data structuresdata structures  from/to text files
    - write blob
    - read blob
    - write tree
    - read tree

- compare indexes
    - simple comparison (compare sorted lists of hashes)
    - bloom filter to compute intersection fast ?

- find duplicates in different tree locations
    -> is there a list of all tree objects where a blob is stored (reverse link)?
