x compute sha1 for single file

x create tree item object
    - hash
    - name
    - list of children

x print index content in ascii
x hide root object in tree
x rename TreeItem to "Item"
x mavenize project
x make jar executable
x create packages
x compute sha1 for tree object

x bootstrap tests

- filter files

- command line interface
    - print analysis outpout as ascii tree

- find what @SafeVarargs means
    -> according to javadoc : calling method can put types that shouldn't fit 
    -> probably to explain that method properly handles
    single or multiple values. like when underlying api provides
        - a method for a single value
        - a method for multiple values
    -> and calling parent method properly handles choosing the right method to call
        like when executing a command line :
        - single param API : full command
        - multiple param API : separated command arguments


- enhance sha1 on tree objects
    - don't use string representation of children hash(es)

- data structures structures  from/to text files
    - write blob
    - read blob
    - write tree
    - read tree

- compare indexes
    - simple comparison (compare sorted lists of hashes)
    - bloom filter to compute intersection fast ?

- find duplicates in different tree locations
    -> is there a list of all tree objects where a blob is stored (reverse link)?
